## Introduction to Rogue Access Points

An Access Point becomes a Rogue Access Point when a person connects an unauthorized
Access Point to the network without obtaining the proper authorization from the administrator.
An employee who wants to have unrestricted access to the internet or a criminal who wants to
steal sensitive information from the employees of an organization will set up a Rogue Access
Point on the network of the organization.

Rogue Access Points will cause major damages to a person or to an entire organization. Rogue
Access Points will allow the attackers to conduct numerous types of attacks such as man in the
middle attack and denial of service attack. An attacker will conduct a man in the middle attack
by creating an independent connection between the employees of the organization and monitor
the information transferred between them. The employees believe that they are on a private
connection and transfer information with each other without knowing that an attacker is
monitoring their entire conversation. An attacker will conduct a denial of service attack by
flooding the network of the organization with numerous unwanted traffic. Attackers spoof the
SSID, BSSID and IP address of the Access Point and attract users by providing them with free
unrestricted internet access. So many users will connect to the spoofed Access Point since it is
providing them with free unrestricted internet access. This will allow the attacker to steal all of
the sensitive information shared by the people and cause major damages to them.

Even though it is extremely difficult to detect Rogue Access Points at once, there are ways to
prevent a person from setting up a Rogue Access Point.

	1. Make strict rules and regulations. Only allow authorized IT personnel to set up Access
	   Points in the cooperate network of the organization. If someone wants to connect to the
	   network by setting up his or her own Access Point, that person should get the proper
	   authorization from the administrator. Organizations should take the necessary legal
	   actions if someone fails to abide by these rules and regulations.
       
	2. Make a list of known attackers and past incidents related to Rogue Access Points. List
	   down all of the Rogue Access Points in the rogue list.
       
	3. Use strong security systems.
    
	4. Check whether there are any suspicious ad-hoc Access Points on the network and
	   investigate those Access Points immediately. Rogue Access Points are ad hoc by
	   default.
       
	5. Always assign static IP addresses to the Access Point instead of using the DHCP server
	   to assign IP addresses to the Access Points. When the Access Points have static IP
	   addresses, the attacker must manually assign an IP address to their Rogue Access Point
	   before installing it on the network.
       
	6. Select the most appropriate countermeasures to detect rogue or suspicious Access
	   Points immediately.
       
	7. Check whether someone has disabled the network management features such as Telnet,
	   HTTP, and SNMP of the Access Point.
       
	8. Check whether the MAC address of the Access Point appears in the ARP table.

	9. Use a port scanning tool to determine the open ports of the Access Point. In a generic
       Access Point, only the main ports (port 80 and port 443) are in the open state. In a
       Rogue or Suspicious Access Point, various ports are in the open state.
